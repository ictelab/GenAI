A simple programme to print an area of a circle

dius: float;

def init(radius: float);
override def area -> float;
}

glob RAD = 10, c = Circle(radius=RAD);

import math;

enum ShapeType;

def calculate_area(radius: float) -> float;
def main_run;

obj Shape {
has shape_type: ShapeType;

def area -> float abs;
}

obj Circle(Shape) {
has ra

with entry:__main__ {
main_run();
